<h1 align="center">FIFA World Cup Performance Analysis</h1>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Every 4 years, FIFA hosts the World's largest and most prestigious footballing tournament to crown one deserving country as the reigning champions of football. A troubled friend approached me recently and expressed that they want to follow the tournament closely next year as this would be their first taste of international football, but didn't know where to start in terms of picking a team to support. I told them that the correct choice would reveal itself to them in time, but until then I could help them choose by providing some worthwhile information regarding the performance of some of the more popular teams.
<h2>My Process</h2>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Go through the data CSV file and understand its contents</li>
  <li> Connect to Tableau to create visualizations</li>
  <li> Conduct reseach to select most generally popular teams for examination</li>
  <li> Configure 9 visualization options showcasing relevant metrics such as goals scored, goals conceded, winning % over time and performance under differing conditions</li>
  <li> Create dashboard with complimentary visualizations and relevant stats </li>
  <li> Complete dashboard formatting and filtering for easy viewing </li>
  </ul>
</p>
